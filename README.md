   React-Typescript <br>Countries Dashboard
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  This is a Countries Dashboard Project built using <strong><em>React.JS</em></strong>, <strong><em>Typescript</em></strong> and <strong><em>Material-UI</em></strong>
  <br><br> 
	 This project is about building a dashboard that connects to an open-source API has information about all countries in the world, gets the data from the API, and displays it in a well-formatted table.

Then we should be able to apply 3 levels of filters (individually or combined) to this data.

First level: Search Filter:<br>
Where we can search in the countries name or capital or languages and display only the countries which have the search term in their name or capital or lanaguges.

Second level: Region Filter:<br>
Where we can filter the countries based on their region.

Third Level: Population Filter:<br>
Where we can filter the countries based on their population number.

 # All Filters Combined

The user can combine the search, region, and population filters and use it all together. 

Example: if the user type "al" & used the Name Checkbox & select "Europe Region" & typed "1000" - "3000000" in the population fields  , he will get all countries which has "al" in their name & exist in "Europe" & has population between "1000" - "3000000".
